            Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Mark</strong>, A Software engineer based in the
            Philippines.
          </p>

          <p className="about__paragraph">
            I love solving real-world problems through code and by building
            responsive websites with great User Experience in mind. JavaScript
            is my main programming language in solving these problems but I am
            also knowledgeable with other languages such as Java and Python
          </p>

          <p className="about__paragraph">
            Aside from coding, I also play football occasionally. If I'm not
            playing sports, I usually use my time learning new stuff online and
            helping others solve their coding problems.
          </p>

          <p className="about__paragraph">
            I also like to travel and explore different cultures around the
            world.
